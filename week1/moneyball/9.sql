-- What salaries are other teams paying?
-- In 9.sql, write a SQL query to find the 5 lowest paying teams (by average salary) in 2001.
-- * Round the average salary column to two decimal places and call it "average salary".
-- * Sort the teams by average salary, least to greatest.
-- * Your query should return two columns, one for the teams' names and one for their average salary.

SELECT "t"."name",ROUND(AVG("s"."salary"),2) AS "average salary"
FROM "teams" "t"
JOIN "salaries" "s" ON "s"."team_id" = "t"."id"
WHERE "s"."year" = 2001
GROUP BY "t"."name"
ORDER BY "average salary"
LIMIT 5;
