-- You need to make a recommendation about which players the team should consider hiring. With the team's annual budget, the general manager wants to look at the 50 players paid the least in 2001.
-- In 4.sql, write a SQL query to find the 50 players paid the least in 2001.
-- * Sort players by salary, lowest to highest.
-- * If two players have the same salary, sort alphabetically by first name and then by last name.
-- * If two players have the same first and last name, sort by player ID.
-- * Your query should return three columns, one for player's first name, one for their last name, and one for their salary.

SELECT "p"."first_name","p"."last_name","s"."salary"
FROM "players" "p"
JOIN "salaries" "s" ON "p"."id" = "s"."player_id"
WHERE "s"."year" = '2001'
ORDER BY "s"."salary","p"."first_name","p"."last_name","p"."id"
LIMIT 50;
